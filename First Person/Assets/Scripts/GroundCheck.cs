//For the purpose of testing character movements, this class will start out simple
//Moving forward, I want to implement these following things:
//1. Check if ANY collider is below object to achieve a "Grounded" state
//2. Use slope of ground to keep charatcers anchored to the floor if they are not jump (no skipping if walking down a slope)
//3. ... I forgot.
